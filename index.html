            <p><code>Networking</code> is the backbone of modern communication, enabling devices to connect and exchange data 
                seamlessly. Whether at home, in the workplace, or across the globe, networks facilitate the transfer 
                of information and ensure that we stay connected.</p>

            <p>A <code>network</code> can be as simple as two computers connected to share files, or as complex as the 
                internet, which links millions of devices worldwide. Understanding the fundamentals of 
                networking is essential for setting up and maintaining a reliable home network.</p>
            
            <p>Setting up a home network allows you to connect multiple devices, such as computers, smartphones,
                tablets, smart TVs, and gaming consoles, to the internet. It also enables file sharing, printer
                access, and other convenient features. With a properly configured home network, you can 
                ensure fast, secure, and reliable connectivity for all your devices.</p>

            <p>This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive guide on networking basics and walk you through the 
                process of setting up a home network. By the end of this guide, you will have the knowledge and 
                confidence to build and manage your home network efficiently.</p>

        <header><h2>Networking Basics</h2></header>
        <div>
            <p>Understanding the basic concepts and components of a network is crucial before setting up your home network.</p>
            <h4>Key Networking Terms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>LAN (Local Area Network): A network confined to a small area, such as a home or office.</li>
                <li>WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that spans large geographical areas.</li>
                <li>Router: A device that directs data between your home network and the internet.</li>
                <li>Switch: A device that connects multiple devices within a LAN.</li>
                <li>IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.</li>
                <li>MAC Address: A hardware address that uniquely identifies a device.</li>
                <li>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices.</li>
                <li>DNS (Domain Name System): Translates domain names into IP addresses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Types of Networks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wired Networks: Use Ethernet cables for connections, providing stability and speed.</li>
                <li>Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi): Use radio signals for connectivity, offering flexibility and convenience.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

        <header><h2>Setting Up a Home Network</h2></header>
        <div>
            <p>Setting up a home network involves several steps to ensure smooth and secure connectivity.</p>
            <h4>Equipment Needed</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Modem</li>
                <li>Router</li>
                <li>Ethernet Cables</li>
                <li>Devices (e.g., PC, Laptop, Smartphone, Smart TV)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Step-by-Step Setup</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Connect the Modem to the ISP Line: Plug the modem into the service line provided by your Internet Service Provider.</li>
                <li>Connect the Router to the Modem: Use an Ethernet cable to link the modem and router.</li>
                <li>Power Up Devices: Turn on the modem and router and wait for them to initialize.</li>
                <li>Access Router Settings: Open a web browser and enter the default IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to configure settings.</li>
                <li>Configure Wi-Fi Network Name (SSID) and Password: Set a unique SSID and a strong password.</li>
                <li>Set Security Settings: Enable WPA2 or WPA3 encryption to protect your network.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Connecting Devices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wired Connection: Plug devices directly into the router using Ethernet cables.</li>
                <li>Wireless Connection: Select your SSID on devices and enter the password.</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="IP_Address_and_DHCP" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>IP Address and DHCP</h2></header>
        <div>
            <h4>IP Address</h4>
            <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device on a network. 
                It serves two main purposes: identifying the host or device and providing the location address in 
                the network. There are two types of IP addresses:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>IPv4: A 32-bit address, represented in the format (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It is the most commonly used version.</li>
                <li>IPv6: A 128-bit address, designed to overcome the limitations of IPv4 and support more devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Static vs. Dynamic IP Address</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Static IP Address: Manually assigned to a device and remains constant. Useful for servers and devices requiring consistent access.</li>
                <li>Dynamic IP Address: Automatically assigned by a network using DHCP and may change over time. Commonly used in home networks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</h4>
            <p>DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. It simplifies the process of IP management 
                by dynamically providing IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS information to devices.</p>

            <h4>How DHCP Works</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Device Request: When a device connects to the network, it sends a request for an IP address.</li>
                <li>DHCP Server Response: The DHCP server assigns an available IP address to the device.</li>
                <li>Device Configuration: The device receives the IP address along with other network configuration details.</li>
                <li>Lease Expiry: The assigned IP address has a lease time, after which it may be renewed or reassigned.</li>
                <p>Using DHCP is recommended in home networks as it reduces configuration errors and simplifies network management.</p>
            </ol>

        <div>
            <p>Securing your home network is vital to protect your devices and data.</p>

            <h4>Security Practices</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Change Default Router Password: Set a unique and strong admin password</li>
                    <li>Enable Network Encryption: Use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li>MAC Address Filtering: Restrict network access to specific devices (optional)</li>
                    <li>Update Router Firmware: Keep the firmware up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.</li>

                    <p>By following these practices, you can ensure a secure and stable home network environment.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Even well-configured networks can experience issues from time to time. Here are some common problems and their solutions:</p>

            <h4>Slow Internet Speed</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Check Your Bandwidth Usage: Ensure no devices are using excessive bandwidth.</li>
                <li>Restart Your Router and Modem: Power cycling can resolve temporary issues.</li>
                <li>Check for Interference: Ensure your router is away from devices like microwaves and cordless phones.</li>
                <li>Upgrade Your Plan: Contact your ISP if your speed is consistently slow.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Connection Drops Frequently</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Check Cables and Connections: Ensure all cables are securely connected.</li>
                <li>Update Firmware: Outdated router firmware can cause stability issues.</li>
                <li>Reduce Network Load: Disconnect unused devices and limit high-bandwidth activities.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>No Internet Connection</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Check Service Status: Contact your ISP to confirm there are no outages.</li>
                <li>Inspect Modem and Router Lights: Check for unusual light patterns indicating issues.</li>
